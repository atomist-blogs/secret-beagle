The simplest possible [Atomist][atomist] software delivery machine
(SDM).

Software delivery machines enable you to control your delivery process
in code.  Think of it as an API for your software delivery.  See the
[Atomist documentation][atomist-doc] for more information on the
concept of a software delivery machine and how to create and develop
an SDM.
